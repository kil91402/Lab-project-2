## About Me

I created a guessing game titled: "About Me".  If the user answers correctly, they are rewarded points.  This was a really neat project.  It really gave me a better understanding of the while loops and if/else.

### Reflections and Comments

As I continue this journey, terminology is starting to come a little easier.  The more I actually perform the work the better understanding I obtain.  Previous experience with coding definitely helps with this course.  I often call my classmates "Team" because I feel together we can all make it through this course.  I often speak to a few of them offline to help encourage and they as well encourage me to get through this.  Our last few classes have started to become fun for us which is a big help with learning.  It eases the tension, settles our minds, and that alone helps with the learning process.  Major shout out to Robert and Thomas for their patience with us.  I hope they know we really appreciate what they do.   This past week has been a huge motivator for me, and it has made me want to motivate my Team even more so.
